Text can be {--deleted--} and replacement text {++added++}. This can also be
combined into {~~one~>a single~~} operation. {==Highlighting==} is also
possible {>>and comments can be added inline<<}.

Formatting can also be applied to blocks by putting the opening and closing
tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content.
